Vector(int initialCapacity, int capacityIncrement) : Vector(initialCapacity) {
    this->capacityIncrement = capacityIncrement;
}

in Java, Vector is a synchronized class, but in C++, it is not. So, if you want to use it in a multi-threaded environment, you need to use it with a mutex.

Methods of vector:
add()
addAll()
addElement()
capacity()
clear()
clone()
