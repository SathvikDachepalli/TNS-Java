Strings in java:

Strings are immutable in java. Once we create a string object we can’t modify it. If we try to modify we will get new object. This is called immutability of strings.

Two ways to create string objects:
1. By using string literal
    - String s = “Sathvik”;
2. By using new operator
    - String s = new String(“Sathvik”);
