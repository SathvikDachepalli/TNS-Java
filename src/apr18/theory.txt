 For instance variables, the value is stored in the object.
 Static variables are stored in the class.
 Static variables are shared by all objects of the class.
 Those are directly accessible without initializing an object.
 Static variables are initialized only once.
 Static variables are initialized when the class is loaded.
 Static can be used on variables, methods, blocks and nested classes.
 
 
  Two ways to access the static variable:
 1. Directly: ClassName.variableName   Single class
 2. Using an object: objectName.variableName   Multiple classes
 
  Static methods can be accessed directly using the class name.
 

        Static block:
        Static block is used to initialize the static data member.
        It is executed before the main method at the time of classloading.
        It is used to provide the initial values to the static variables.
        syntax:
           static{
        
            //code to be executed
           
        }
        This will be executed on its on before the main method. We dont need to call it explicitly.

Static block needs reference no need to have a main method.
Static block is executed before the main method at the time of class loading.
Static block is used to provide the initial values to the static variables.
Static block is executed only once.
Static block is executed before the constructor.
